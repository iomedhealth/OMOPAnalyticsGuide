# Data Mediation

Data Mediation is the process of providing researchers with access to
standardized, research-ready clinical data. This process begins after a
hospital has completed the [Data Enablement](./../data_enablement/index.md),
which is a prerequisite for mediation.

The mediation process ensures that data is shared securely, ethically, and in
compliance with all relevant regulations. It connects data holders (hospitals)
with data users (researchers) through a structured, auditable workflow.

The key stages of this process include:

### Mediation Request

Researchers initiate a request by developing a protocol, defining the required clinical variables (concept sets), and specifying the patient population (cohort). This ensures the study is scientifically valid and provides data holders with full transparency over how their data will be used.

### Mediation Approval

Data holders review the request, secure necessary approvals from ethics committees, and finalize contractual agreements before granting access to the data. IOMED's platform provides the tools to manage this workflow, giving the hospital full control over the approval process.

### Quality Assurance

Once a request is approved, we perform rigorous checks to validate the generated dataset against the original request. This includes automated verification and validation by clinical experts to ensure the dataset is accurate, complete, and clinically plausible for the specific research question. This QA process is distinct from the initial data transformation that occurs during enablement; it is focused on the quality of the specific data order.

### Compliance and Delivery

After a final compliance check, the fully anonymized and standardized dataset is securely delivered to the researcher. The entire process is auditable, ensuring that data access is compliant with GDPR and other applicable regulations. The data remains within the hospital's secure environment at all times, with only the approved, anonymized dataset being delivered.
