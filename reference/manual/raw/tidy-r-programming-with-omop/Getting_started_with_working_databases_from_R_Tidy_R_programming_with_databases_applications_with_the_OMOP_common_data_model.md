# Getting started with working databases from R

In this first half of the book we will see how we can work with databases from R. In the following chapters we’ll see that when working with data held in a relational database we can leverage various open-source R packages to help us perform tidyverse-style data analyses.

  * In [1 A first analysis using data in a database](working_with_databases_from_r.html) we will perform a simple data analysis from start to finish using a table in a database.
  * In [2 Core verbs for analytic pipelines utilising a database](tidyverse_verbs.html) we will see in more detail how familiar dplyr functions can be used to combine data spread across different tables in a database into an analytic dataset which we can then bring into R for further analysis.
  * In [3 Supported expressions for database queries](tidyverse_expressions.html) we will see how we can perform more complex data manipulation via translation of R code into SQL specific to the database management system being used.
  * In [4 Building analytic pipelines for a data model](dbplyr_packages.html) we will see how we can build data pipelines by creating a data model in R to represent the relational database we’re working with and creating functions and methods to work with it.
