# Collapse cohort entries using a certain gap to concatenate records.

Source: [`R/collapseCohorts.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortConstructor/blob/main/R/collapseCohorts.R)

`collapseCohorts.Rd`

`collapseCohorts()` concatenates cohort records, allowing for some number of days between one finishing and the next starting.

## Usage
    
    
    collapseCohorts(
      cohort,
      cohortId = NULL,
      gap = 0,
      name = [tableName](https://darwin-eu.github.io/omopgenerics/reference/tableName.html)(cohort),
      .softValidation = FALSE
    )

## Arguments

cohort
    

A cohort table in a cdm reference.

cohortId
    

Vector identifying which cohorts to modify (cohort_definition_id or cohort_name). If NULL, all cohorts will be used; otherwise, only the specified cohorts will be modified, and the rest will remain unchanged.

gap
    

Number of days between two subsequent cohort entries to be merged in a single cohort record.

name
    

Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.

.softValidation
    

Whether to perform a soft validation of consistency. If set to FALSE four additional checks will be performed: 1) a check that cohort end date is not before cohort start date, 2) a check that there are no missing values in required columns, 3) a check that cohort duration is all within observation period, and 4) that there are no overlapping cohort entries

## Value

A cohort table
