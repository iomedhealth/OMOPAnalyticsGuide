# Restrict cohort to specific entry

Source: [`R/requireIsEntry.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/CohortConstructor/blob/main/R/requireIsEntry.R)

`requireIsEntry.Rd`

`[requireIsFirstEntry()](requireIsFirstEntry.html)` filters cohort records, keeping only the first cohort entry per person.

## Usage
    
    
    requireIsEntry(
      cohort,
      entryRange,
      cohortId = NULL,
      name = [tableName](https://darwin-eu.github.io/omopgenerics/reference/tableName.html)(cohort),
      .softValidation = TRUE
    )

## Arguments

cohort
    

A cohort table in a cdm reference.

entryRange
    

Range for entries to include.

cohortId
    

Vector identifying which cohorts to modify (cohort_definition_id or cohort_name). If NULL, all cohorts will be used; otherwise, only the specified cohorts will be modified, and the rest will remain unchanged.

name
    

Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.

.softValidation
    

Whether to perform a soft validation of consistency. If set to FALSE four additional checks will be performed: 1) a check that cohort end date is not before cohort start date, 2) a check that there are no missing values in required columns, 3) a check that cohort duration is all within observation period, and 4) that there are no overlapping cohort entries

## Value

A cohort table in a cdm reference.

## Examples
    
    
    # \donttest{
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([CohortConstructor](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortConstructor/))
    cdm <- [mockCohortConstructor](mockCohortConstructor.html)()
    cdm$cohort1 <- requireIsEntry(cdm$cohort1, [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(1, Inf))
    # }
