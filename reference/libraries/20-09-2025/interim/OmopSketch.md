# OmopSketch 

The goal of OmopSketch is to characterise and visualise an OMOP CDM instance to asses if it meets the necessary criteria to answer a specific clinical question and conduct a certain study.

## Installation

You can install the development version of OmopSketch from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
    
    
    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::[install_github](https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html)("OHDSI/OmopSketch")

## Example

Let’s start by creating a cdm object using the Eunomia mock dataset:
    
    
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([duckdb](https://r.duckdb.org/))
    #> Loading required package: DBI
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([CDMConnector](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/))
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), warn.conflicts = FALSE)
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))
    con <- [dbConnect](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html)([duckdb](https://r.duckdb.org/reference/duckdb.html)(), [eunomiaDir](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/reference/eunomiaDir.html)())
    cdm <- [cdmFromCon](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/reference/cdmFromCon.html)(con = con, cdmSchema = "main", writeSchema = "main")
    #> Note: method with signature 'DBIConnection#Id' chosen for function 'dbExistsTable',
    #>  target signature 'duckdb_connection#Id'.
    #>  "duckdb_connection#ANY" would also be valid
    #> ! cdm name not specified and could not be inferred from the cdm source table
    cdm
    #> 
    #> ── # OMOP CDM reference (duckdb) of An OMOP CDM database ───────────────────────
    #> • omop tables: person, observation_period, visit_occurrence, visit_detail,
    #> condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, procedure_occurrence, device_exposure,
    #> measurement, observation, death, note, note_nlp, specimen, fact_relationship,
    #> location, care_site, provider, payer_plan_period, cost, drug_era, dose_era,

    #> concept_class, concept_relationship, relationship, concept_synonym,
    #> concept_ancestor, source_to_concept_map, drug_strength
    #> • cohort tables: -
    #> • achilles tables: -
    #> • other tables: -

### Snapshot

We first create a snapshot of our database. This will allow us to track when the analysis has been conducted and capture details about the CDM version or the data release.
    
    
    [summariseOmopSnapshot](reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html)(cdm) |>
      [tableOmopSnapshot](reference/tableOmopSnapshot.html)(type = "flextable")

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

### Characterise the clinical tables

Once we have collected the snapshot information, we can start characterising the clinical tables of the CDM. By using `[summariseClinicalRecords()](reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)` and `[tableClinicalRecords()](reference/tableClinicalRecords.html)`, we can easily visualise the main characteristics of specific clinical tables.
    
    
    [summariseClinicalRecords](reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm, [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure")) |>
      [tableClinicalRecords](reference/tableClinicalRecords.html)(type = "flextable")
    #> ℹ Adding variables of interest to condition_occurrence.
    #> ℹ Summarising records per person in condition_occurrence.
    #> ℹ Summarising condition_occurrence: `in_observation`, `standard_concept`,
    #>   `source_vocabulary`, `domain_id`, and `type_concept`.
    #> ℹ Adding variables of interest to drug_exposure.
    #> ℹ Summarising records per person in drug_exposure.
    #> ℹ Summarising drug_exposure: `in_observation`, `standard_concept`,
    #>   `source_vocabulary`, `domain_id`, and `type_concept`.

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

We can also explore trends in the clinical table records over time.
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure"), interval = "years") |>
      [plotRecordCount](reference/plotRecordCount.html)(facet = "omop_table", colour = "cdm_name")

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

### Characterise the observation period

After visualising the main characteristics of our clinical tables, we can explore the observation period details. OmopSketch provides several functions to have an overview the dataset study period.

Using `[summariseInObservation()](reference/summariseInObservation.html)` and `[plotInObservation()](reference/plotInObservation.html)`, we can gather information on the number of records per year.
    
    
    [summariseInObservation](reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period, output = "records", interval = "years") |>
      [plotInObservation](reference/plotInObservation.html)(colour = "cdm_name")
    #> `result_id` is not present in result.
    #> `result_id` is not present in result.

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

You can also visualise and explore the characteristics of the observation period per each individual in the database using `[summariseObservationPeriod()](reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)`.
    
    
    [summariseObservationPeriod](reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm$observation_period) |>
      [tableObservationPeriod](reference/tableObservationPeriod.html)(type = "flextable")

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

Or if visualisation is preferred, you can easily build a histogram to explore how many participants have more than one observation period.
    
    
    [summariseObservationPeriod](reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm$observation_period) |>
      [plotObservationPeriod](reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)(colour = "observation_period_ordinal")

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

### Characterise the concepts

OmopSketch also provides functions to explore some of (or all) the concepts in the dataset.
    
    
    acetaminophen <- [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(1125315,  1127433, 1127078)
    
    [summariseConceptSetCounts](reference/summariseConceptSetCounts.html)(cdm, conceptSet = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("acetaminophen" = acetaminophen)) |>
      [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)(variable_name == "Number records") |> 
      [plotConceptSetCounts](reference/plotConceptSetCounts.html)(colour = "codelist_name")
    #> Warning: ! `codelist` contains numeric values, they are casted to integers.
    #> ℹ Searching concepts from domain drug in drug_exposure.
    #> ℹ Counting concepts

![](reference/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

As seen, OmopSketch offers multiple functionalities to provide a general overview of a database. Additionally, it includes more tools and arguments that allow for deeper exploration, helping to assess the database’s suitability for specific research studies. For further information, please refer to the vignettes.

# Summarise clinical tables records

Source: [`vignettes/summarise_clinical_tables_records.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/summarise_clinical_tables_records.Rmd)

`summarise_clinical_tables_records.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will explore the _OmopSketch_ functions designed to provide an overview of the clinical tables within a CDM object (e.g.  _visit_occurrence_ , _condition_occurrence_ , _drug_exposure_ , _procedure_occurrence_ , _device_exposure_ , _measurement_ , _observation_ , and _death_). Specifically, there are four key functions that facilitate this:

  * `[summariseClinicalRecords()](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)` and `[tableClinicalRecords()](../reference/tableClinicalRecords.html)`: Use them to create a summary statistics with key basic information of the clinical table (e.g., number of records, number of concepts mapped, etc.)

  * `[summariseRecordCount()](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)`, `[plotRecordCount()](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)` and `[tableRecordCount()](../reference/tableRecordCount.html)`: Use them to summarise the number of records within specific time intervals.




### Create a mock cdm

Let’s see an example of its functionalities. To start with, we will load essential packages and create a mock cdm using the mockOmopSketch() database.
    
    
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org))
    #> 
    #> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    #> 
    #>     filter, lag
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    #> 
    #>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))
    
    # Connect to mock database
    cdm <- [mockOmopSketch](../reference/mockOmopSketch.html)()

## Summarise clinical tables

Let’s now use `summariseClinicalTables()`from the OmopSketch package to help us have an overview of one of the clinical tables of the cdm (i.e., **condition_occurrence**).
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseClinicalRecords](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm, "condition_occurrence")

    #> #   estimate_name <chr>, estimate_type <chr>, estimate_value <chr>,

Notice that the output is in the summarised result format.

We can use the arguments to specify which statistics we want to perform. For example, use the argument `recordsPerPerson` to indicate which estimates you are interested regarding the number of records per person.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseClinicalRecords](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm,
      "condition_occurrence",
      recordsPerPerson = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd", "q05", "q95")

    #> 4 records_per_person q95           102

You can further specify if you want to include the number of records in observation (`inObservation = TRUE`), the number of concepts mapped (`standardConcept = TRUE`), which types of source vocabulary does the table contain (`sourceVocabulary = TRUE`), which types of domain does the vocabulary have (`domainId = TRUE`) or the concept’s type (`typeConcept = TRUE`).

Additionally, you can also stratify the previous results by sex and age groups:
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseClinicalRecords](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm,
      "condition_occurrence",
      recordsPerPerson = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd", "q05", "q95"),
      quality = TRUE, 
      conceptSummary = TRUE,
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("<35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 34), ">=35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(35, Inf))

    #> $ estimate_value <chr> "100", "100", "84", "10.1802", "68", "102.0500", "8400"…

Notice that, by default, the “overall” group will be also included, as well as crossed strata (that means, sex == “Female” and ageGroup == “>35”).

Also, see that the analysis can be conducted for multiple OMOP tables at the same time:
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseClinicalRecords](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm,
      [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("visit_occurrence", "drug_exposure"),
      recordsPerPerson = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd"),

    )

    #> $ estimate_value <chr> "100", "100", "346.1100", "116.9244", "34611", "100", "…

We can also filter the clinical table to a specific time window by setting the dateRange argument.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseClinicalRecords](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure",
      dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("1990-01-01", "2010-01-01")))

### Tidy the summarised object

`[tableClinicalRecords()](../reference/tableClinicalRecords.html)` will help you to tidy the previous results and create a gt table.

## Summarise record counts

OmopSketch can also help you to summarise the trend of the records of an OMOP table. See the example below, where we use `[summariseRecordCount()](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)` to count the number of records within each year, and then, we use `[plotRecordCount()](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)` to create a ggplot with the trend. We can also use `[tableRecordCount()](../reference/tableRecordCount.html)` to display results in a table of type [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) or [datatable](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/). By default it creates a [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) table.

Note that you can adjust the time interval period using the `interval` argument, which can be set to either “years”, “months” or “quarters”. See the example below, where it shows the number of records every 18 months:
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure", interval = "quarters") |>
      [plotRecordCount](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)()

![](summarise_clinical_tables_records_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

We can further stratify our counts by sex (setting argument `sex = TRUE`) or by age (providing an age group). Notice that in both cases, the function will automatically create a group called _overall_ with all the sex groups and all the age groups.
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure",
      interval = "months",
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)(
        "<30" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 29),
        ">=30" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(30, Inf)
      )
    ) |>
      [plotRecordCount](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)()

![](summarise_clinical_tables_records_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

By default, `[plotRecordCount()](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)` does not apply faceting or colour to any variables. This can result confusing when stratifying by different variables, as seen in the previous picture. We can use [VisOmopResults](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/) package to help us know by which columns we can colour or face by:
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure",
      interval = "months",
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)(
        "0-29" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 29),
        "30-Inf" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(30, Inf)
      )
    ) |>
      visOmopResults::[tidyColumns](https://darwin-eu.github.io/omopgenerics/reference/tidyColumns.html)()
    #>  [1] "cdm_name"       "omop_table"     "sex"            "age_group"     
    #>  [5] "variable_name"  "variable_level" "count"          "percentage"    
    #>  [9] "time_interval"  "interval"       "type"

Then, we can simply specify this by using the `facet` and `colour` arguments from `[plotRecordCount()](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)`
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure",
      interval = "months",
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)(
        "0-29" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 29),
        "30-Inf" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(30, Inf)
      )
    ) |>
      [plotRecordCount](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)(facet = omop_table ~ age_group, colour = "sex")

![](summarise_clinical_tables_records_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png) We can also filter the clinical table to a specific time window by setting the dateRange argument.
    
    
    [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm, "drug_exposure",
      interval = "years",
      sex = TRUE, 
      dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("1990-01-01", "2010-01-01"))) |>

# Summarise concept id counts

Source: [`vignettes/summarise_concept_id_counts.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/summarise_concept_id_counts.Rmd)

`summarise_concept_id_counts.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will explore the _OmopSketch_ functions designed to provide information about the number of counts of concepts in tables. Specifically, there are two key functions that facilitate this, `[summariseConceptIdCounts()](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)` and `[tableConceptIdCounts()](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)`. The former one creates a summary statistics results with the number of counts per each concept in the clinical table, and the latter one displays the result in a table.

### Create a mock cdm

Let’s see an example of the previous functions. To start with, we will load essential packages and create a mock cdm using `[mockOmopSketch()](../reference/mockOmopSketch.html)`.
    
    
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([duckdb](https://r.duckdb.org/))

## Summarise concept id counts

We now use the `[summariseConceptIdCounts()](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)` function from the OmopSketch package to retrieve counts for each concept id and name, as well as for each source concept id and name, across the clinical tables.

By default, the function returns the number of records (`estimate_name == "count_records"`) for each concept_id. To include counts by person, you can set the `countBy` argument to `"person"` or to c`("record", "person")` to obtain both record and person counts.

Further stratification can be applied using the `interval`, `sex`, and `ageGroup` arguments. The interval argument supports “overall” (no time stratification), “years”, “quarters”, or “months”.

### Display the results

Finally, concept counts can be visualised using `[tableConceptIdCounts()](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)`. By default, it generates an interactive [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) table, but [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) datatables are also supported.
    
    
    result <- [summariseConceptIdCounts](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = "measurement",
      countBy = "record"
    ) 
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, type = "reactable")
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, type = "datatable")

The `display` argument in tableConceptIdCounts() controls which concept counts are shown. Available options include `display = "overall"`. It is the default option and it shows both standard and source concept counts.
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, display = "overall")

If `display = "standard"` the table shows only **standard** concept_id and concept_name counts.
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, display = "standard")

If `display = "source"` the table shows only **source** concept_id and concept_name counts.
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, display = "source")
    #> Warning: Values from `estimate_value` are not uniquely identified; output will contain
    #> list-cols.
    #> • Use `values_fn = list` to suppress this warning.
    #> • Use `values_fn = {summary_fun}` to summarise duplicates.
    #> • Use the following dplyr code to identify duplicates.
    #>   {data} |>
    #>   dplyr::summarise(n = dplyr::n(), .by = c(cdm_name, group_level,
    #>   source_concept_name, source_concept_id, result_id, group_name, estimate_type,
    #>   estimate_name)) |>
    #>   dplyr::filter(n > 1L)

If `display = "missing source"` the table shows only counts for concept ids that are missing a corresponding source concept id.
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, display = "missing source")

If `display = "missing standard"` the table shows only counts for source concept ids that are missing a mapped standard concept id.
    
    
    [tableConceptIdCounts](../reference/tableConceptIdCounts.html)(result, display = "missing standard")
    #> Warning: `result` does not contain any `summarise_concept_id_counts`
    #> data.

### Display the most frequent concepts

You can use the `[tableTopConceptCounts()](../reference/tableTopConceptCounts.html)` function to display the most frequent concepts in a OMOP CDM table in formatted table. By default, the function returns a [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) table, but you can also choose from other output formats, including [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/), [datatable](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/).
    
    
    result <- [summariseConceptIdCounts](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = "drug_exposure",
      countBy = "record"
    ) 
    [tableTopConceptCounts](../reference/tableTopConceptCounts.html)(result, type = "gt")

#### Customising the number of top concepts

By default, the function shows the top 10 concepts. You can change this using the `top` argument:
    
    
    [tableTopConceptCounts](../reference/tableTopConceptCounts.html)(result, top = 5)

#### Choosing the count type

If your summary includes both record and person counts, you must specify which type to display using the `countBy` argument:
    
    
    result <- [summariseConceptIdCounts](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = "drug_exposure",
      countBy = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record", "person")
    ) 
    [tableTopConceptCounts](../reference/tableTopConceptCounts.html)(result, countBy = "person")

# Summarise observation period

Source: [`vignettes/summarise_observation_period.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/summarise_observation_period.Rmd)

`summarise_observation_period.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we will explore the _OmopSketch_ functions designed to provide an overview of the `observation_period` table. Specifically, there are six key functions that facilitate this:

  * `[summariseObservationPeriod()](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)`, `[plotObservationPeriod()](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)` and `[tableObservationPeriod()](../reference/tableObservationPeriod.html)`: Use them to get some overall statistics describing the `observation_period` table
  * `[summariseInObservation()](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)`, `[plotInObservation()](../reference/plotInObservation.html)`, `[tableInObservation()](../reference/tableInObservation.html)`: Use them to summarise the trend in the number of records, individuals, person-days and females in observation during specific intervals of time and how the median age varies.



### Create a mock cdm

Let’s see an example of its functionalities. To start with, we will load essential packages and create a mock cdm using the mockOmopSketch() database.
    
    
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org))
    #> 
    #> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    #> 
    #>     filter, lag
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    #> 
    #>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))
    
    # Connect to mock database
    cdm <- [mockOmopSketch](../reference/mockOmopSketch.html)()

## Summarise observation periods

Let’s now use the `[summariseObservationPeriod()](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)` function from the OmopSketch package to help us have an overview of one of the `observation_period` table, including some statistics such as the `Number of subjects` and `Duration in days` for each observation period (e.g., 1st, 2nd)
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm = cdm)
    
    summarisedResult
    #> # A tibble: 3,126 × 13

    #>  7         1 mockOmopSketch observation_pe… all         overall     overall     
    #>  8         1 mockOmopSketch observation_pe… all         overall     overall     
    #>  9         1 mockOmopSketch observation_pe… all         overall     overall     
    #> 10         1 mockOmopSketch observation_pe… all         overall     overall     
    #> # ℹ 3,116 more rows
    #> # ℹ 7 more variables: variable_name <chr>, variable_level <chr>,
    #> #   estimate_name <chr>, estimate_type <chr>, estimate_value <chr>,
    #> #   additional_name <chr>, additional_level <chr>

Notice that the output is in the summarised result format.

We can use the arguments to specify which statistics we want to perform. For example, use the argument `estimates` to indicate which estimates you are interested regarding the `Duration in days` of the observation period.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(
      cdm = cdm,
      estimates = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd", "q05", "q95")
    )
    
    summarisedResult |>
      [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)(variable_name == "Duration in days") |>
      [select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)(group_level, variable_name, estimate_name, estimate_value)
    #> # A tibble: 8 × 4
    #>   group_level variable_name    estimate_name estimate_value  
    #>   <chr>       <chr>            <chr>         <chr>           
    #> 1 all         Duration in days mean          3459.34         
    #> 2 all         Duration in days sd            3586.96925956871
    #> 3 all         Duration in days q05           45              
    #> 4 all         Duration in days q95           9766            
    #> 5 1st         Duration in days mean          3459.34         
    #> 6 1st         Duration in days sd            3586.96925956871
    #> 7 1st         Duration in days q05           45              
    #> 8 1st         Duration in days q95           9766

Additionally, you can stratify the results by sex and age groups, and specify a date range of interest:
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(
      cdm = cdm,
      estimates = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd", "q05", "q95"),
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("<35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 34), ">=35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(35, Inf)),
      dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("1970-01-01", "2010-01-01"))
    )

Notice that, by default, the “overall” group will be also included, as well as crossed strata (that means, sex == “Female” and ageGroup == “>35”).

### Tidy the summarised object

`[tableObservationPeriod()](../reference/tableObservationPeriod.html)` will help you to create a table (see supported types with: visOmopResults::tableType()). By default it creates a [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) table.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(

### Visualise the results

Finally, we can visualise the result using `[plotObservationPeriod()](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)`.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm = cdm)
    
    [plotObservationPeriod](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)(
      result = summarisedResult,
      variableName = "Number subjects",
      plotType = "barplot"
    )

![](summarise_observation_period_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

Note that either `Number subjects` or `Duration in days` can be plotted. For `Number of subjects`, the plot type can be `barplot`, whereas for `Duration in days`, the plot type can be `barplot`, `boxplot`, or `densityplot`.”

Additionally, if results were stratified by sex or age group, we can further use `facet` or `colour` arguments to highlight the different results in the plot. To help us identify by which variables we can colour or facet by, we can use [visOmopResult](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/) package.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm = cdm, sex = TRUE)
    [plotObservationPeriod](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)(
      result = summarisedResult,
      variableName = "Duration in days",
      plotType = "boxplot",
      facet = "sex"
    )

![](summarise_observation_period_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)
    
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(
      cdm = cdm,
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("<35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 34), ">=35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(35, Inf))
    )
    [plotObservationPeriod](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)(summarisedResult,
      colour = "sex",
      facet = "age_group"
    )

## Summarise in observation

OmopSketch can also help you to summarise the number of records in observation during specific intervals of time.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period,
      interval = "years"
    )
    
    summarisedResult |>
      [select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)(variable_name, estimate_name, estimate_value, additional_name, additional_level)
    #> # A tibble: 132 × 5
    #>    variable_name   estimate_name estimate_value additional_name additional_level
    #>    <chr>           <chr>         <chr>          <chr>           <chr>           
    #>  1 Records in obs… count         1              time_interval   1955-01-01 to 1…
    #>  2 Records in obs… percentage    1.00           time_interval   1955-01-01 to 1…

    #>  6 Records in obs… percentage    3.00           time_interval   1957-01-01 to 1…
    #>  7 Records in obs… count         4              time_interval   1958-01-01 to 1…
    #>  8 Records in obs… percentage    4.00           time_interval   1958-01-01 to 1…

    #> # ℹ 122 more rows

Note that you can adjust the time interval period using the `interval` argument, which can be set to either “years”, “quarters”, “months” or “overall” (default value).
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period,
      interval = "months"
    )

Along with the number of records in observation, you can also calculate the number of person-days by setting the `output` argument to c(“record”, “person-days”).
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period, 
                                               output = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record", "person-days"))                                        
    
    
    summarisedResult |>
      [select](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)(variable_name, estimate_name, estimate_value, additional_name, additional_level)
    #> # A tibble: 4 × 5
    #>   variable_name    estimate_name estimate_value additional_name additional_level
    #>   <chr>            <chr>         <chr>          <chr>           <chr>           
    #> 1 Records in obse… count         100            overall         overall         
    #> 2 Person-days      count         345934         overall         overall         
    #> 3 Records in obse… percentage    100.00         overall         overall         
    #> 4 Person-days      percentage    100.00         overall         overall

We can further stratify our counts by sex (setting argument `sex = TRUE`) or by age (providing an age group). Notice that in both cases, the function will automatically create a group called _overall_ with all the sex groups and all the age groups. We can also define a date range of interest to filter the `observation_period` table accordingly.
    
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period,

                                               sex = TRUE, 
                                               ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("<35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 34), ">=35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(35, Inf)),

You can include additional output metrics by them to the output argument:

If `output = "person"`, the trend in the number of individuals in observation is returned.

If `output = "age`, the trend in the median age of the population in observation is calculated. If `ageGroup` and `interval` are both specified, the age is computed at the beginning of the interval or of the observation period, whichever is more recent.

### Tidy the summarised object

`tableInObservartion()` will help you to create a table of type [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), [reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) or [datatable](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/). By default it creates a [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) table.

### Visualise the results

Finally, we can visualise the trend using `[plotInObservation()](../reference/plotInObservation.html)`.
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period,
      interval = "years"
    )
    [plotInObservation](../reference/plotInObservation.html)(summarisedResult)

![](summarise_observation_period_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

Notice that one output at a time can be plotted. If more outputs have been included in the summarised result, you will have to filter to only include one variable at time.

Additionally, if results were stratified by sex or age group, we can further use `facet` or `colour` arguments to highlight the different results in the plot. To help us identify by which variables we can colour or facet by, we can use [visOmopResult](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/) package.
    
    
    
    summarisedResult <- [summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period, 
                           interval = "years",
                           output = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record", "age"),
                           sex = TRUE,
                           ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)("<35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 34), ">=35" = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(35, Inf))) 
    [plotInObservation](../reference/plotInObservation.html)(summarisedResult |> 
      [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)(variable_name == "Age in observation"),
      colour = "sex", 
      facet = "age_group")

Finally, disconnect from the cdm

# Characterisation of OMOP CDM

Source: [`vignettes/characterisation.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/characterisation.Rmd)

`characterisation.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we explore how _OmopSketch_ functions can serve as a valuable tool for characterising databases containing electronic health records mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model.

### Create a mock cdm

Let’s see an example of its functionalities. To start with, we will load essential packages and connect to a test CDM using the Eunomia dataset.

    cdm <- [cdmFromCon](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/reference/cdmFromCon.html)(
      con = con, cdmSchema = "main", writeSchema = "main", cdmName = "Eunomia"
    )

## Snapshot

Let’s start by using the `[summariseOmopSnapshot()](../reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html)` function to summarise the available metadata of the cdm_reference object, including the vocabulary version and the time span covered by the `observation_period` table
    
    
    snapshot <- [summariseOmopSnapshot](../reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html)(cdm)
    snapshot |>
      [tableOmopSnapshot](../reference/tableOmopSnapshot.html)()

## Clinical tables characterisation

Next, we define the tables of interest, specify the study period, and determine whether to stratify the analysis by sex, age groups, or time intervals.
    
    
    tableName <- [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(
    "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence",
      "device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"
    )
    
    dateRange <- [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("2012-01-01", NA))
    
    sex <- TRUE
    
    ageGroup <- [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 59), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(60, Inf))
    
    interval <- "years"

### Missing values

We can now use the `[summariseMissingData()](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)` function to assess the presence of missing values in the tables.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = tableName,
      sex = sex,
      ageGroup = ageGroup,
      interval = interval,
      dateRange = dateRange
    )
    result_missingData |> [glimpse](https://pillar.r-lib.org/reference/glimpse.html)()

### Clinical tables overview

The function `sumamriseClinicalRecords()` provides key insights into the clinical tables content, including the number of records, number of subjects, portion of records in observation, and the number of distinct domains and concepts.

### Records in observation

We can retrieve the number of records in observation for each table using the `[summariseRecordCount()](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)` function.
    
    
    result_recordCounts <- [summariseRecordCount](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)(cdm,
      tableName,
      sex = sex,
      ageGroup = ageGroup,
      interval = interval,
      dateRange = dateRange
    )
    result_recordCounts |>
      [filter](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)(group_level [%in%](https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html) [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("drug_exposure", "condition_occurrence")) |>
      [plotRecordCount](../reference/plotRecordCount.html)(
        colour = "omop_table",
        facet = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("sex", "age_group")
      )

![](characterisation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

### Concept id counts

We can then use the `[summariseConceptIdCounts()](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)` function to compute the record counts for each concept_id present in the analysed OMOP tables.
    
    
    result_conceptIdCount <- OmopSketch::[summariseConceptIdCounts](../reference/summariseConceptIdCounts.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = tableName,
      sex = sex,
      ageGroup = ageGroup,
      interval = interval,
      dateRange = dateRange
    )

## Observation period characterisation

`OmopSketch` can also provide an overview of the `observation_period` table.

### Subjects in observation

The `[summariseInObservation()](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)` function calculates the number of subjects and the distribution of person-days in observation across specific time intervals.
    
    
    
    result_inObservation <-[summariseInObservation](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)(cdm$observation_period,
                                                  output = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record","person-days"),
                                                  interval = interval,
                                                  sex = sex,
                                                  ageGroup = ageGroup,

### Observation periods

From the `observation_table`, we can extract information on the duration of observation periods, the time until the next observation period, and the number of subjects in each ordinal observation period (1st, 2nd, etc.). This can be done using the `[summariseObservationPeriod()](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)` function.
    
    
    result_observationPeriod <- [summariseObservationPeriod](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)(cdm$observation_period,
      sex = sex,
      ageGroup = ageGroup,
      dateRange = dateRange
    )
    #> ℹ retrieving cdm object from cdm_table.
    
    result_observationPeriod |>
      [plotObservationPeriod](../reference/plotObservationPeriod.html)(
        variableName = "Duration in days",
        plotType = "boxplot",
        colour = "sex",
        facet = "age_group"
      )

![](characterisation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

Finally, disconnect from the cdm
    
    
    PatientProfiles::[mockDisconnect](https://darwin-eu.github.io/PatientProfiles/reference/mockDisconnect.html)(cdm = cdm)

The results of the characterisation using `OmopSketch` can be further explored through the ShinyApp at <https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/OmopSketch-vignette/>

# Summarise missing data

Source: [`vignettes/missing_data.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/missing_data.Rmd)

`missing_data.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we explore how _OmopSketch_ functions can serve as a valuable tool for summarising missingness in databases containing electronic health records mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model.

### Create a mock cdm

To illustrate the package’s functionality, we begin by loading the required packages and connecting to a test CDM using the Eunomia dataset.

### Summary of missing data

A common first step in data quality assessment is to identify missing values. In this contest, missing data are defined as either NA values or concept IDs equal to 0.

You can use the `[summariseMissingData()](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)` function to summarise missingness across the clinical tables in the CDM:
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = "observation_period")
    
    result_missingData |> [glimpse](https://pillar.r-lib.org/reference/glimpse.html)()
    #> Rows: 16
    #> Columns: 13
    #> $ result_id        <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1

#### Summarise by OMOP CDM table

You can choose to summarise missing data for specific OMOP CDM tables using the argument `omopTableName`.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"))

#### Summarise by sex

You can choose to summarise missing data by sex by setting the argument `sex` to `TRUE`.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"),
                                               sex = TRUE)

#### Summarise by age group

You can choose to summarise missing data by age group by creating a list defining the age groups you want to use.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"), 
                                               ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 17), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(18, 64), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(65, 150)))

#### Summarise by date and/or time interval

You can also summarise missing data within a specific date range or across defined time intervals using the `dateRange` and `interval` arguments. The `interval` argument supports “overall” (no time stratification), “years”, “quarters”, or “months”.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"), 
                                               interval = "years",
                                               dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("2012-01-01", "2019-01-01")))

#### Summarise by column

You can also choose to summarise missing data for specific columns in the OMOP CDM tables using the argument `col`.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"),
                                               col = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period_start_date",
                                                       "observation_period_end_date"))

#### Summarise in sample of OMOP CDM

Finally, you can summarise missing data on a sample of records from the OMOP CDM tables by specifying the desired number of records with the `sample` argument.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm = cdm, 
                                               omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("observation_period", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence","device_exposure", "measurement", "observation", "death"),
                                               sample = 1000)

#### Visualise summary results

You can present these results using the function `[tableMissingData()](../reference/tableMissingData.html)`.
    
    
    result_missingData <- [summariseMissingData](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)(cdm,
      omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("condition_occurrence", "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence"),
      sex = TRUE,
      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0, 17), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(18, 64), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(65, 150)),
      interval = "years",
      dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("2012-01-01", "2019-01-01")),
      sample = 100000
    )

# Summarise database characteristics

Source: [`vignettes/database_characteristics.Rmd`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/vignettes/database_characteristics.Rmd)

`database_characteristics.Rmd`

## Introduction

In this vignette, we explore how the _OmopSketch_ function `[databaseCharacteristics()](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)` and `[shinyCharacteristics()](../reference/shinyCharacteristics.html)` can serve as a valuable tool for characterising databases containing electronic health records mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model.

### Create a mock cdm

We begin by loading the necessary packages and creating a mock CDM using the `[mockOmopSketch()](../reference/mockOmopSketch.html)` function:
    
    
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org))
    #> 
    #> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    #> 
    #>     filter, lag
    #> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    #> 
    #>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))
    
    cdm <- [mockOmopSketch](../reference/mockOmopSketch.html)()
    
    cdm
    #> 
    #> ── # OMOP CDM reference (duckdb) of mockOmopSketch ─────────────────────────────
    #> • omop tables: cdm_source, concept, concept_ancestor, concept_relationship,
    #> concept_synonym, condition_occurrence, death, device_exposure, drug_exposure,
    #> drug_strength, measurement, observation, observation_period, person,
    #> procedure_occurrence, visit_occurrence, vocabulary
    #> • cohort tables: -
    #> • achilles tables: -
    #> • other tables: -

## Summarise database characteristics

The `[databaseCharacteristics()](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)` function provides a comprehensive summary of the CDM, returning a [summarised result](https://darwin-eu-dev.github.io/omopgenerics/articles/summarised_result.html) that includes:

  * A general database snapshot, using `[summariseOmopSnapshot()](../reference/summariseOmopSnapshot.html)`

  * A characterisation of the population in observation, built using the [CohortConstructor](https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortConstructor/) and [CohortCharacteristics](https://darwin-eu.github.io/CohortCharacteristics/) packages

  * A summary of the observation period table using `[summariseObservationPeriod()](../reference/summariseObservationPeriod.html)` and `[summariseInObservation()](../reference/summariseInObservation.html)`

  * A data quality assessment of the clinical tables using `[summariseMissingData()](../reference/summariseMissingData.html)`

  * A characterisation of the clinical tables with `[summariseClinicalRecords()](../reference/summariseClinicalRecords.html)` and `[summariseRecordCount()](../reference/summariseRecordCount.html)`



    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm)

### Selecting tables to characterise

By default, the following OMOP tables are included in the characterisation: _person_ , _observation_period_ , _visit_occurrence_ , _condition_occurrence_ , _drug_exposure_ , _procedure_occurrence_ , _device_exposure_ , _measurement_ , _observation_ , _death_.

You can customise which tables to include in the analysis by specifying them with the `omopTableName` argument.
    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm, omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("drug_exposure", "condition_occurrence"))

### Stratifying by Sex

To stratify the characterisation results by sex, set the `sex` argument to `TRUE`:
    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm, omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("drug_exposure", "condition_occurrence"),
                                      sex = TRUE)

### Stratifying by Age Group

You can choose to characterise the data stratifying by age group by creating a list defining the age groups you want to use.
    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm, omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("drug_exposure", "condition_occurrence"),
                                      ageGroup = [list](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(0,50), [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)(51,100)))

### Filtering by date range and time interval

Use the `dateRange` argument to limit the analysis to a specific period. Combine it with the `interval` argument to stratify results by time. Valid values for interval include “overall” (default), “years”, “quarters”, and “months”:
    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm,
                                     interval = "years",
                                     dateRange = [as.Date](https://rdrr.io/r/base/as.Date.html)([c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("2010-01-01", "2018-12-31")))

### Including Concept Counts

To include concept counts in the characterisation, set `conceptIdCounts = TRUE`:
    
    
    result <- [databaseCharacteristics](../reference/databaseCharacteristics.html)(cdm,
                                      conceptIdCounts = TRUE)

## Visualise the characterisation results

To explore the characterisation results interactively, you can use the `[shinyCharacteristics()](../reference/shinyCharacteristics.html)` function. This function generates a Shiny application in the specified `directory`, allowing you to browse, filter, and visualise the results through an intuitive user interface.
    
    
    [shinyCharacteristics](../reference/shinyCharacteristics.html)(result = result, directory = "path/to/your/shiny")

### Customise the Shiny App

You can customise the title, logo, and theme of the Shiny app by setting the appropriate arguments:

  * `title`: The title displayed at the top of the app

  * `logo`: Path to a custom logo (must be in SVG format)

  * `theme`: A custom Bootstrap theme (e.g., using bslib::bs_theme())



    
    
    [shinyCharacteristics](../reference/shinyCharacteristics.html)(result = result, directory = "path/to/my/shiny",
                         title = "Characterisation of my data",
                         logo = "path/to/my/logo.svg",
                         theme = "bslib::bs_theme(bootswatch = 'flatly')")

An example of the Shiny application generated by `[shinyCharacteristics()](../reference/shinyCharacteristics.html)` can be explored [here](https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/OmopSketchCharacterisation/), where the characterisation of several synthetic datasets is available.

# Create a visual table from a summarise_omop_snapshot result.

Source: [`R/tableOmopSnapshot.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/tableOmopSnapshot.R)

`tableOmopSnapshot.Rd`

Create a visual table from a summarise_omop_snapshot result.

## Usage
    
    
    tableOmopSnapshot(result, type = "gt", style = "default")

## Arguments

result
    

Output from summariseOmopSnapshot().

type
    

Type of formatting output table. See `[visOmopResults::tableType()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableType.html)` for allowed options. Default is `"gt"`.

style
    

Named list that specifies how to style the different parts of the gt or flextable table generated. Accepted style entries are: title, subtitle, header, header_name, header_level, column_name, group_label, and body. Alternatively, use "default" to get visOmopResults style, or NULL for gt/flextable style. Keep in mind that styling code is different for gt and flextable. Additionally, "datatable" and "reactable" have their own style functions. To see style options for each table type use `[visOmopResults::tableStyle()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableStyle.html)`

## Value

A formatted table object with the summarised data.

# Summarise an omop table from a cdm object. You will obtain information related to the number of records, number of subjects, whether the records are in observation, number of present domains, number of present concepts, missing data and inconsistencies in start date and end date

Source: [`R/summariseClinicalRecords.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/summariseClinicalRecords.R)

`summariseClinicalRecords.Rd`

Summarise an omop table from a cdm object. You will obtain information related to the number of records, number of subjects, whether the records are in observation, number of present domains, number of present concepts, missing data and inconsistencies in start date and end date

## Usage
    
    
    summariseClinicalRecords(
      cdm,
      omopTableName,
      recordsPerPerson = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("mean", "sd", "median", "q25", "q75", "min", "max"),
      conceptSummary = TRUE,
      missingData = TRUE,
      quality = TRUE,
      sex = FALSE,
      ageGroup = NULL,
      dateRange = NULL,
      inObservation = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      standardConcept = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      sourceVocabulary = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      domainId = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      typeConcept = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)()
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm_reference object.

omopTableName
    

A character vector of the names of the tables to summarise in the cdm object. Run `[OmopSketch::clinicalTables()](clinicalTables.html)` to check the available options.

recordsPerPerson
    

Generates summary statistics for the number of records per person. Set to NULL if no summary statistics are required.

conceptSummary
    

Logical. If `TRUE`, includes summaries of concept-level information, including:

  * Domain ID of standard concepts

  * Type concept ID

  * Standard vs non-standard concepts

  * Source vocabulary usage



missingData
    

Logical. If `TRUE`, includes a summary of missing data for relevant fields.

quality
    

Logical. If `TRUE`, performs basic data quality checks, including:

  * Percentage of records within the observation period

  * Number of records with end date before start date

  * Number of records with start date before the person's birth date



sex
    

Boolean variable. Whether to stratify by sex (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

ageGroup
    

A list of age groups to stratify results by.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

inObservation
    

Deprecated. Use `quality = TRUE` instead.

standardConcept
    

Deprecated. Use `conceptSummary = TRUE` instead.

sourceVocabulary
    

Deprecated. Use `conceptSummary = TRUE` instead.

domainId
    

Deprecated. Use `conceptSummary = TRUE` instead.

typeConcept
    

Deprecated. Use `conceptSummary = TRUE` instead.

## Value

A summarised_result object.

      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm_reference object.

omopTableName
    

A character vector of omop tables from the cdm.

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

ageGroup
    

A list of age groups to stratify results by.

sex
    

Whether to stratify by sex (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

sample
    

An integer to sample the tables to only that number of records. If NULL no sample is done.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

# Create a visual table from a summariseObservationPeriod() result.

Source: [`R/tableObservationPeriod.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/tableObservationPeriod.R)

`tableObservationPeriod.Rd`

Create a visual table from a summariseObservationPeriod() result.

## Usage
    
    
    tableObservationPeriod(result, type = "gt", style = "default")

## Arguments

result
    

A summarised_result object.

type
    

Type of formatting output table. See `[visOmopResults::tableType()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableType.html)` for allowed options. Default is `"gt"`.

style
    

Named list that specifies how to style the different parts of the gt or flextable table generated. Accepted style entries are: title, subtitle, header, header_name, header_level, column_name, group_label, and body. Alternatively, use "default" to get visOmopResults style, or NULL for gt/flextable style. Keep in mind that styling code is different for gt and flextable. Additionally, "datatable" and "reactable" have their own style functions. To see style options for each table type use `[visOmopResults::tableStyle()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableStyle.html)`

## Value

A formatted table object with the summarised data.

## Examples

# Summarise concept counts in patient-level data. Only concepts recorded during observation period are counted.

Source: [`R/summariseConceptSetCounts.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/summariseConceptSetCounts.R)

`summariseConceptSetCounts.Rd`

Summarise concept counts in patient-level data. Only concepts recorded during observation period are counted.

## Usage
    
    
    summariseConceptSetCounts(
      cdm,
      conceptSet,
      countBy = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record", "person"),
      concept = TRUE,
      interval = "overall",
      sex = FALSE,
      ageGroup = NULL,
      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm object

conceptSet
    

List of concept IDs to summarise.

countBy
    

Either "record" for record-level counts or "person" for person-level counts

concept
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by concept.

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

sex
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by sex.

ageGroup
    

A list of ageGroup vectors of length two. Code use will be thus summarised by age groups.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

## Value

A summarised_result object with results overall and, if specified, by strata.

## Examples
    
    
    # \donttest{
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))

# Summarise missing data in omop tables

Source: [`R/summariseMissingData.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/summariseMissingData.R)

`summariseMissingData.Rd`

Summarise missing data in omop tables

## Usage
    
    
    summariseMissingData(
      cdm,
      omopTableName,
      col = NULL,
      sex = FALSE,
      year = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      interval = "overall",
      ageGroup = NULL,
      sample = 1e+06,
      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm object

omopTableName
    

A character vector of the names of the tables to summarise in the cdm object.

col
    

A character vector of column names to check for missing values. If `NULL`, all columns in the specified tables are checked. Default is `NULL`.

sex
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by sex.

year
    

deprecated

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

ageGroup
    

A list of ageGroup vectors of length two. Code use will be thus summarised by age groups.

sample
    

An integer to sample the table to only that number of records. If NULL no sample is done.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

## Value

A summarised_result object with results overall and, if specified, by strata.

## Examples
    
    
    # \donttest{
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))
    
    cdm <- [mockOmopSketch](mockOmopSketch.html)(numberIndividuals = 100)
    
    result <- summariseMissingData (cdm = cdm,
    omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("condition_occurrence", "visit_occurrence"),
    sample = 10000)
    
    PatientProfiles::[mockDisconnect](https://darwin-eu.github.io/PatientProfiles/reference/mockDisconnect.html)(cdm)
    # }

# Create a visual table from a summariseMissingData() result.

Source: [`R/tableMissingData.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/tableMissingData.R)

`tableMissingData.Rd`

Create a visual table from a summariseMissingData() result.

## Usage
    
    
    tableMissingData(result, type = "gt", style = "default")

## Arguments

result
    

A summarised_result object.

type
    

Type of formatting output table. See `[visOmopResults::tableType()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableType.html)` for allowed options. Default is `"gt"`.

style
    

Named list that specifies how to style the different parts of the gt or flextable table generated. Accepted style entries are: title, subtitle, header, header_name, header_level, column_name, group_label, and body. Alternatively, use "default" to get visOmopResults style, or NULL for gt/flextable style. Keep in mind that styling code is different for gt and flextable. Additionally, "datatable" and "reactable" have their own style functions. To see style options for each table type use `[visOmopResults::tableStyle()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableStyle.html)`

## Value

A formatted table object with the summarised data.

## Examples
    
    
    # \donttest{
    [library](https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html)([OmopSketch](https://OHDSI.github.io/OmopSketch/))

`summariseConceptIdCounts.Rd`

Summarise concept use in patient-level data. Only concepts recorded during observation period are counted.

## Usage
    
    
    summariseConceptIdCounts(
      cdm,
      omopTableName,
      countBy = "record",
      year = lifecycle::[deprecated](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/reference/deprecated.html)(),
      interval = "overall",
      sex = FALSE,
      ageGroup = NULL,
      sample = NULL,
      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm object

omopTableName
    

A character vector of the names of the tables to summarise in the cdm object.

countBy
    

Either "record" for record-level counts or "person" for person-level counts

year
    

deprecated

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

sex
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by sex.

ageGroup
    

A list of ageGroup vectors of length two. Code use will be thus summarised by age groups.

sample
    

An integer to sample the tables to only that number of records. If NULL no sample is done.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

## Value

A summarised_result object with results overall and, if specified, by strata.

# Create a visual table of the most common concepts from `summariseConceptIdCounts()` output. This function takes a `summarised_result` object and generates a formatted table highlighting the most frequent concepts.

Source: [`R/tableTopConceptCounts.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/tableTopConceptCounts.R)

`tableTopConceptCounts.Rd`

Create a visual table of the most common concepts from `[summariseConceptIdCounts()](summariseConceptIdCounts.html)` output. This function takes a `summarised_result` object and generates a formatted table highlighting the most frequent concepts.

## Usage
    
    
    tableTopConceptCounts(
      result,
      top = 10,
      countBy = NULL,
      type = "gt",
      style = "default"
    )

## Arguments

result
    

A `summarised_result` object, typically returned by `[summariseConceptIdCounts()](summariseConceptIdCounts.html)`.

top
    

Integer. The number of top concepts to display. Defaults to `10`.

countBy
    

Either 'person' or 'record'. If NULL whatever is in the data is used.

type
    

Character. The output table format. Defaults to `"gt"`. Use `[visOmopResults::tableType()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableType.html)` to see all supported formats.

style
    

Named list that specifies how to style the different parts of the gt or flextable table generated. Accepted style entries are: title, subtitle, header, header_name, header_level, column_name, group_label, and body. Alternatively, use "default" to get visOmopResults style, or NULL for gt/flextable style. Keep in mind that styling code is different for gt and flextable. Additionally, "datatable" and "reactable" have their own style functions. To see style options for each table type use `[visOmopResults::tableStyle()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableStyle.html)`

## Value

A formatted table object displaying the top concepts from the summarised data.

# Summarise temporal trends in OMOP tables

Source: [`R/summariseTrend.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/summariseTrend.R)

`summariseTrend.Rd`

This function summarises temporal trends from OMOP CDM tables, considering only data within the observation period. It supports both event and episode tables and can report trends such as number of records, number of subjects, person-days, median age, and number of females.

## Usage
    
    
    summariseTrend(
      cdm,
      event = NULL,
      episode = NULL,
      output = "record",
      interval = "overall",
      ageGroup = NULL,
      sex = FALSE,
      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A `cdm_reference` object.

event
    

A character vector of OMOP table names to treat as event tables (uses only start date).

episode
    

A character vector of OMOP table names to treat as episode tables (uses start and end date).

output
    

A character vector indicating what to summarise. Options include `"record"` (default), `"person"`, `"person-days"`, `"age"`, `"sex"`. If included, the number of person-days is computed only for episode tables.

interval
    

Time granularity for trends. One of `"overall"` (default), `"years"`, `"quarters"`, or `"months"`.

ageGroup
    

A list of age groups to stratify results by.

sex
    

Logical. If `TRUE`, stratify results by sex.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

## Value

A summarised_result object.

## Details

  * **Event tables** : Records are included if their **start date** falls within the study period. Each record contributes to the time interval containing the start date.

  * **Episode tables** : Records are included if their **start or end date** overlaps with the study period. Records are **trimmed** to the date range, and contribute to **all** overlapping time intervals between start and end dates.

# Create a visual table from a summariseTrend() result.

Source: [`R/tableTrend.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/tableTrend.R)

`tableTrend.Rd`

Create a visual table from a summariseTrend() result.

## Usage
    
    
    tableTrend(result, type = "gt", style = "default")

## Arguments

result
    

A summarised_result object.

type
    

Type of formatting output table between `gt`, `datatable` and `reactable`. Default is `"gt"`.

style
    

Named list that specifies how to style the different parts of the gt or flextable table generated. Accepted style entries are: title, subtitle, header, header_name, header_level, column_name, group_label, and body. Alternatively, use "default" to get visOmopResults style, or NULL for gt/flextable style. Keep in mind that styling code is different for gt and flextable. Additionally, "datatable" and "reactable" have their own style functions. To see style options for each table type use `[visOmopResults::tableStyle()](https://darwin-eu.github.io/visOmopResults/reference/tableStyle.html)`

## Value

A formatted table object with the summarised data.

Source: [`R/databaseCharacteristics.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/databaseCharacteristics.R)

`databaseCharacteristics.Rd`

Summarise Database Characteristics for OMOP CDM

## Usage
    
    
    databaseCharacteristics(
      cdm,
      omopTableName = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("person", "visit_occurrence", "condition_occurrence",
        "drug_exposure", "procedure_occurrence", "device_exposure", "measurement",
        "observation", "death"),
      sex = FALSE,
      ageGroup = NULL,
      dateRange = NULL,
      interval = "overall",
      conceptIdCounts = FALSE,
      ...
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A `cdm_reference` object representing the Common Data Model (CDM) reference.

omopTableName
    

A character vector specifying the OMOP tables from the CDM to include in the analysis. If "person" is present, it will only be used for missing value summarisation.

sex
    

Logical; whether to stratify results by sex (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).

ageGroup
    

A list of age groups to stratify the results by. Each element represents a specific age range.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

conceptIdCounts
    

Logical; whether to summarise concept ID counts (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).

...
    

additional arguments passed to the OmopSketch functions that are used internally.

## Value

A `summarised_result` object containing the results of the characterisation.

      theme = NULL
    )

## Arguments

result
    

A summarised_result object containing the results from the `[databaseCharacteristics()](databaseCharacteristics.html)` function. This object should include summaries of various OMOP CDM tables, such as population characteristics, clinical records, missing data, and more

directory
    

A character string specifying the directory where the application will be saved.

background
    

Background panel for the Shiny app. If set to `TRUE` (default), a standard background panel with a general description will be included. If set to `FALSE`, no background panel will be displayed. Alternatively, you can provide a file path (e.g., `"path/to/file.md"`) to include custom background content from a Markdown file.

title
    

Title of the shiny. Default is "Characterisation"

logo
    

Name of a logo or path to a logo. If NULL no logo is included. Only svg format allowed for the moment.

theme
    

A character string specifying the theme for the Shiny application. Default is `"bslib::bs_theme(bootswatch = 'flatly')"` to use the Flatly theme from the Bootswatch collection. You can customise this to use other themes.

## Value

This function invisibly returns NULL and generates a static Shiny app in the specified directory.

## Examples
    
    
    if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{

# Summarise concept counts in patient-level data. Only concepts recorded during observation period are counted.

Source: [`R/summariseConceptCounts.R`](https://github.com/OHDSI/OmopSketch/blob/main/R/summariseConceptCounts.R)

`summariseConceptCounts.Rd`

[![\[Deprecated\]](figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated)

## Usage
    
    
    summariseConceptCounts(
      cdm,
      conceptId,
      countBy = [c](https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html)("record", "person"),
      concept = TRUE,
      interval = "overall",
      sex = FALSE,
      ageGroup = NULL,
      dateRange = NULL
    )

## Arguments

cdm
    

A cdm object

conceptId
    

List of concept IDs to summarise.

countBy
    

Either "record" for record-level counts or "person" for person-level counts

concept
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by concept.

interval
    

Time interval to stratify by. It can either be "years", "quarters", "months" or "overall".

sex
    

TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE code use will be summarised by sex.

ageGroup
    

A list of ageGroup vectors of length two. Code use will be thus summarised by age groups.

dateRange
    

A vector of two dates defining the desired study period. Only the `start_date` column of the OMOP table is checked to ensure it falls within this range. If `dateRange` is `NULL`, no restriction is applied.

## Value

A summarised_result object with results overall and, if specified, by strata.
