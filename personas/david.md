### Persona: David, the Seasoned Biostatistician

1. Profile

• Name: David
• Age: 48
• Role: Senior Biostatistician
• Experience: 15+ years in clinical trials and real-world data analysis for a major pharmaceutical company.
• Background: Holds a Ph.D. in Biostatistics. He is a respected expert in designing and executing complex statistical analyses for regulatory submissions and publications.

2. Technical Skills & Expertise

• Primary Tools: SAS (expert), STATA (proficient), SPSS (proficient). He is deeply comfortable with the procedural nature of these languages and has a library of personal macros and scripts he has
perfected over the years.
• Domain Knowledge: Deep expertise in survival analysis, longitudinal data modeling, and generalized linear models. His data model expertise is primarily in CDISC standards (especially SDTM), and he has a strong understanding of real-world data sources like insurance claims and electronic health records (EHR).

3. Current Situation & Project

David has been assigned to a new, high-profile project focused on generating real-world evidence from a large, federated network of databases. The entire analytical pipeline for this project is built on
the OMOP Common Data Model and utilizes R for all analyses. This is a significant departure from his usual toolkit.

4. Goals & Motivations

• Primary Goal: To quickly become proficient in R and OMOP so he can apply his statistical expertise to the new project and deliver high-quality results.
• Secondary Goal: To understand the benefits and limitations of this new stack compared to his traditional methods. He is motivated to stay current with industry trends.
• Personal Motivation: He wants to overcome the feeling of being a novice again and prove that his foundational knowledge in statistics is transferable and valuable, regardless of the programming
language.

5. Challenges & Pain Points

• Conceptual Shift: Moving from the dataset-oriented world of SAS to the object-oriented and functional programming paradigm of R is challenging. He often thinks in DATA steps and PROCs, and translating
that logic to dplyr verbs and functions is not yet intuitive.
• OMOP Complexity: The OMOP CDM's normalized structure is foreign to him. He is used to wide, denormalized analysis datasets. Figuring out which of the many tables (condition_occurrence, drug_exposure,
measurement, etc.) to join to get the data he needs is a constant struggle.
• "Why can't I just...?": He frequently gets frustrated because tasks that are simple for him in SAS (e.g., lagging a variable, complex data merges) require him to learn a new function or concept in R's
Tidyverse.
• Loss of Efficiency: What would have taken him an hour in SAS now takes a day of searching through documentation, tutorials, and forums like Stack Overflow. This loss of productivity is a major source
of frustration.
• Tooling Overload: He is overwhelmed by the sheer number of R packages and is unsure which ones are considered the "gold standard" for OMOP research.

6. A-Day-in-the-Life Snippet

David sits at his desk with two monitors. On one, he has an RStudio window open with a script that keeps throwing cryptic errors about mismatched data types. On the other, he has a browser with multiple
tabs open: a tutorial on dplyr's group_by and summarise, the official OMOP documentation for the person table, and a forum post about connecting R to a database. He sighs, muttering, "In SAS, I would
have just used a PROC SQL and been done with this two hours ago. Now, where is the visit_occurrence_id supposed to come from again?"
