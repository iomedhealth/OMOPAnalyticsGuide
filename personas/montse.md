### Persona: Montse, the Clinical Operations Expert & CRO Founder

1.  **Profile**
    *   **Name**: Montse
    *   **Age**: 52
    *   **Role**: Founder and CEO of her own Clinical Research Organization (CRO).
    *   **Experience**: 20+ years in the pharmaceutical and clinical research industry.
    *   **Background**: A physician by training (M.D.), she chose a path in clinical operations over clinical practice. Her career trajectory is a testament to her deep understanding of how clinical trials are run on the ground: she started as a Clinical Research Associate (CRA), became a monitor, then a senior study coordinator, before taking the entrepreneurial leap to start her own successful CRO.

2.  **Skills & Expertise**
    *   **Primary Strengths**: Deep, hands-on expertise in clinical study execution, protocol design, site management, and regulatory compliance. She is an expert in the operational lifecycle of a study, from feasibility to close-out.
    *   **Domain Knowledge**: Understands the nuances of clinical data from the point of collection. She knows *why* certain data points might be missing, the challenges of patient recruitment, and how a protocol's design impacts the data that is ultimately collected.
    *   **Technical Skills**: Very limited. She is highly proficient with clinical trial management systems (CTMS) and EDC (Electronic Data Capture) platforms from a user perspective but has little to no experience in programming (R, SAS, Python) or data standards like OMOP or CDISC.

3.  **Current Situation & Goals**
    *   **Goal**: To leverage real-world data (RWD) and the OMOP CDM to expand her CRO's services beyond traditional clinical trials, offering clients services like post-market surveillance, feasibility analysis using RWD, and comparative effectiveness studies.
    *   **Challenge**: She needs to understand the OMOP CDM and the analytical processes well enough to have credible, intelligent conversations with both her clients and her technical data science teams. She doesn't need to code, but she needs to grasp the concepts to bridge the gap between clinical questions and technical implementation.

4.  **Challenges & Pain Points**
    *   **The "Black Box" of Analysis**: Her biggest frustration is the disconnect between a clear clinical question and the technical steps required to answer it. She often feels like she's "throwing a question over the wall" to the data team and getting a result back without fully understanding the assumptions and steps in between.
    *   **Data Standards are Opaque**: While she understands the *goal* of data standardization, the technical details of the OMOP CDM feel like an unnecessary layer of complexity. She often thinks, "I just want to know how many patients have this condition. Why do we need to worry about concept IDs, domains, and vocabularies?"
    *   **Lost in Translation**: She struggles to articulate her clinical questions in a way that data scientists can easily translate into code. Nuances that are obvious to a clinician (e.g., distinguishing between a diagnosis and a differential diagnosis) can be lost, leading to flawed results.
    *   **Inability to Validate**: Unlike a clinical trial protocol, she cannot directly read or validate the analytical code. She has to place a great deal of trust in her technical team, which is uncomfortable for someone used to overseeing every detail of a study.

5.  **A-Day-in-the-Life Snippet**

    Montse is in a meeting with a client and her lead data scientist, Patrick. The client wants to know the incidence of a specific adverse event in patients taking their new drug versus a competitor's. Montse expertly outlines the clinical parameters for the study. Patrick then starts discussing the need to define the drug eras, create a washout period to identify new users, and select the right concept sets for the outcome. Montse follows the high-level logic but quickly gets lost in the terminology. She finds herself nodding along, but making a mental note to ask Patrick later: "Can you just draw me a picture of what a 'drug era' is and why it's different from just looking at the prescription dates?"
