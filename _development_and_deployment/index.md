# Development and Deployment

The repository utilizes a sophisticated build and deployment pipeline leveraging Quarto for content generation and GitHub Actions for automated publishing.

## Project Configuration
The project utilizes RStudio project settings optimized for collaborative development and educational delivery:

- **Encoding** : UTF-8 for international compatibility
- **Code Style** : 2-space indentation with automatic formatting
- **Version Control** : Git integration with automatic newline handling
- **Workspace Management** : Default session restoration for continuity

The `Setup.R` script provides automated verification of package dependencies and environment configuration, ensuring students can quickly validate their development environment before beginning coursework.

## Publishing Workflow
Details on the publishing workflow will be provided here.
