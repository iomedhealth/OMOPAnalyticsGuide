# Overview

## Purpose and Scope

The IOMED Real World Evidence Summer School 2025 repository serves as a comprehensive educational platform and R package ecosystem for teaching real-world evidence analytics using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This repository combines instructional materials, interactive presentations, practical exercises, and a suite of specialized R packages designed for epidemiological research and healthcare data analysis.

The repository encompasses both the educational content delivery system and the underlying analytics infrastructure, providing students with hands-on experience in conducting descriptive analyses, building patient cohorts, and performing specialized studies using standardized healthcare data formats.

For information about specific R package implementations, see [R Package Reference](./package_reference). For details about the curriculum structure and learning activities, see [Educational Materials](./educational_materials).

## Repository Architecture

The repository follows a dual-purpose architecture serving as both an educational platform and a functional R package ecosystem. The system is built around Quarto for content delivery and GitHub Actions for automated publishing.
